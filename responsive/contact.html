        <h2>About Elden Ring Nightreign</h2>
        <p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a new cooperative action-survival game set in the Elden Ring universe, developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It takes place in the shadowed realm of Limveld, a world consumed by an endless night where survival depends on skill, teamwork, and adaptability. Players take on the role of “Nightfarers,” each with unique powers and combat styles, as they battle to survive through cycles of darkness and light. The game supports up to three players, blending Elden Ring’s challenging combat and deep atmosphere with a faster, session-based structure. Every expedition brings new threats, dynamic environments, and powerful bosses like the mysterious Nightlord.</p>
        <p>Nightreign reimagines the spirit of Elden Ring in a new format focused on cooperation and replayability. Instead of the vast open-world exploration of the main game, players must rely on one another to endure the hostile landscape and uncover the secrets behind the eternal night. With its signature difficulty, detailed environments, and haunting tone, Nightreign carries the same intensity that made Elden Ring legendary. It stands as both a fresh experience and a respectful extension of the series’ mythos, offering fans a new way to brave the world of darkness together.</p>
